## How to contribute ? 

   - Curretly we have only taken into consderation the parameters like the elevation, slope,temperature of the area and the mass of the animal. Due to lack of raw data we are unable to take into consideration the parameters like the frequently used route of the wild life , life sustaining resources that may attract animal to change the course of their route and so on.
   - The new contributions can  be to incorporate these datas after conducting considerable study of patterns of wildlife in a particular area.
